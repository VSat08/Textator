#Textator

This website is designed to help you quickly and easily analyze and manipulate your text. Whether you need to check the word count of your document, remove unnecessary spaces and line breaks, or perform other common text operations, our website has you covered.

To get started, simply paste your text into the text box on the homepage and select the operation you want to perform . Our website currently supports the following operations:

Word count: This will tell you how many words are in your text.
Character count: This will tell you how many characters (including spaces) are in your text.
Uppercase: This will convert all text to uppercase.
Lowercase: This will convert all text to lowercase.
Capitalize: This will capitalize the first letter of each word.
Inverts: Inverts the current case of your text.
Once you have selected your operation, simply click the button and our website will perform the operation on your text. The modified text will be displayed below the text box, and you can copy it to your clipboard as well.

We hope that Textator will be a useful tool for you. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us using the information provided on our website.
